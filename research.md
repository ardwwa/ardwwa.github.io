### First steps in atmospheric science...

My first research project was also my introduction to atmospheric science. In the summer of 2011 I took an undergraduate RA position in [Professor Shaun Lovejoy's](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~gang/Lovejoy.htm) climate physics group at McGill, where I learned the importance of scale in understanding climate. Over the course of two years, I looked at how various general circulation models (GCMs) predicted temperature should fluctuate on different time scales, from hours to centuries. 

In principle, one should expect to see relatively large variability at time scales that are comparable to the lifetimes of typical weather systems (on the order of a few hours or days). Zooming out to the scale of months or a few years, however, and removing seasonal trends, variability should decline as fluctuations due to weather average out. Finally, on time scales from decades to centuries and millennia, temperature variability must rise again to reflect, for example, glacial-interglacial cycling. Professor Lovejoy calls these scaling regimes weather, macroweather, and climate, respectively, and each has different statistical properties, as demonstrated in this figure:

Each time series is 720 points long, has had its mean subtracted, and is normalized by its standard deviation. Resolutions from bottom to top are 0.067 seconds, 1 hour, 20 days, and 100 years.
