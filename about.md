I work with Professor Daniel Jacob in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group ([ACMG](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. I'm mainly interested in using satellite observations to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics (as well as English literature, in a second degree) at McGill University. You can take a look at <a href="{{ site.url }}/cv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano (mainly classical, though I sometimes dabble in jazz).
