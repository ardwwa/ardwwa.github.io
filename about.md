I'm a PhD student working with Professor Daniel Jacob in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. We've teamed up with [GHGSat, Inc.](https://www.ghgsat.com/) to develop algorithms for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from space using fine-resolution satellite observations.

<!-- 
Space-based instruments have allowed us to monitor the entire globe on a daily basis, including regions where ground observations may be impossible. Data retrieved from these instruments continue to play an important role in the production of climate and air quality policy. However, interpreting it is a highly uncertain area of research. My goal is to develop new techniques for processing satellite data that will improve our understanding of the Earth as seen from space.

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics and English literature at McGill before coming to Harvard. Feel free to view <a href="{{ site.url }}/cv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano.
