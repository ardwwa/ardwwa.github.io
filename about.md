I work with Professor Daniel Jacob in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group ([ACMG](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. I am mainly interested in using satellite observations to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, and studied physics (as well as English literature, in a second degree) at McGill University. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing piano (mostly classical, though I sometimes dabble in jazz).
