I'm a postdoctoral researcher working with Daniel Jacob in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I focus on satellite remote sensing of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Please see my [research page] for more information. 

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics and English literature at McGill before coming to Harvard. Feel free to view <a href="{{ site.url }}/djvcv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano.
