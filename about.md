I work with Professor Daniel Jacob in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group ([ACMG](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. I'm mainly interested in using satellite observations to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants on Earth. 

The advent of space-based optical systems has allowed us to monitor the entire globe on a daily basis, including regions where, whether for infrastructural or political reasons, ground observations are impossible. Data retrieved from these systems continue to play an important role in the production of climate and air quality policy. However, their interpretation remains a highly uncertain area of research. In my work, I hope to contribute to the development of new applications of satellite data, and to help improve our understanding of the Earth as seen from space.

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics (as well as English literature, in a second degree) at McGill University. You can take a look at <a href="{{ site.url }}/cv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details. z &#8764 0.9, also 0.858 &#8804 z &#8804 0.946.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano.
