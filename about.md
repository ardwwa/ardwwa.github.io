I work with Professor Daniel Jacob in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group ([ACMG](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard. I'm mainly interested in using satellite observations to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants on Earth. 

Space-based instruments have allowed us to monitor the entire globe on a daily basis, including regions where ground observations may be impossible due to infrastructural or political limitations. Data retrieved from these instruments continue to play an important role in the production of climate and air quality policy. However, interpreting the data is a highly uncertain area of research. I hope to help develop new applications for satellite data, and to improve our understanding of the Earth as seen from space.

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics (as well as English literature, in a second degree) at McGill University. Feel free to view <a href="{{ site.url }}/cv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano.
