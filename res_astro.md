In 2013, I worked in [Professor Tracy Webb's](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~webb/) astrophysics group at McGill. Professor Webb studies cosmological structure formation, which is the science of how large-scale structures grow in the universe. 

This field is full of open questions, but the current paradigm is that large-scale structures formed from gravitationally merging small-scale structures. In this "hierarchical" picture, stars formed earliest, and clusters of stars made the first galaxies. Galaxies then merged to form galaxy clusters, and so on. Today, the largest known structures in the universe are galaxy superclusters, which are clusters of galaxy clusters. Most of them are still in the process of assembly.

In the Webb group, I studied a rare galaxy supercluster called RCS2319+00, which consists of three high-mass galaxy clusters. RCS2319 is considered rare because it's located at redshift *z* &sim; 0.9; i.e., it's about eight billion lightyears away from Earth. (The cosmological redshift *z* describes the extent to which light emitted by celestial objects at different distances from Earth is redshifted by the expansion of the universe.) Since most galaxy superclusters are still being assembled today, that means RCS2319 formed about eight billion years ahead of its time. 

My project was to quantify the star formation rates of the brightest infrared galaxies in RCS2319. These "starburst" galaxies can produce hundreds to thousands of stars per year. First, I built a database of galaxies in the supercluster by picking them out of a catalogue of over 200,000 celestial objects. Then I matched them with objects in an infrared catalogue covering the same area of the sky. In total, I identified 38 luminous infrared galaxies in the supercluster. Finally to estimate their star formation rates, I fit an infrared galaxy model to each of their spectra. All in all, I estimated the RCS2319 was forming about 2100 solar masses per year.
