In the summer of 2013 I became a research assistant in [Professor Tracy Webb](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~webb/)'s astrophysics group at McGill. Professor Webb's group studies cosmological structure formation---the science of how structure, from stars to galaxy clusters, forms in the cosmos. 

The current paradigm is "hierarchical" in that large-scale structures are thought to have formed from gravitationally merging smaller-scale ones. In this picture, stars are the first to form. Over time, they cluster into galaxies, which slowly merge to form galaxy clusters, and so on. As a result of this hierarchy, structures of different sizes form over different time scales, with the largest objects taking the longest to assemble. Today, the largest known structures in the universe, still in the process of assembly, are clusters of galaxy clusters called "superclusters."

In 2013, Professor Webb's work was largely focused on a rare galaxy supercluster called RCS2319+00, comprising three high-mass galaxy clusters in close proximity. RCS2319 is considered rare because it is located at redshift *z* &sim; 0.9, which translates to a light-travel distance of eight billion lightyears from Earth. This means that we are witnessing RCS2319 form eight billion years ahead of its time. (The cosmological redshift *z* is a distance measure describing the extent to which light emitted by celestial objects at different distances from Earth is redshifted by the expansion of the universe.)

My job was to quantify the star formation rates of the brightest infrared galaxies in RCS2319. Known as "starburst" galaxies, these galaxies can produce hundreds or thousands of solar masses per year. The first step was to build a database of the galaxies forming the supercluster by selecting objects, based on redshift and coordinates in the plane of the sky, from a large multiwavelength spectroscopic catalogue containing information on over 200,000 celestial objects. I then had to match the selected objects to those in a 250 &mu;m catalogue covering the same area of the sky. In this way, I identified 38 luminous infrared galaxies in the broad supercluster redshift range 0.858 &le; *z* &le; 0.946.
