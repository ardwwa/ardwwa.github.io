In the <em>summer</em> of 2013 I became a research assistant in [Professor Tracy Webb](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~webb/)'s astrophysics group at McGill. Broadly speaking, Professor Webb's group studies cosmological structure formation---the science of how structure, from stars to galaxy clusters, forms in the cosmos. 

The current paradigm is "hierarchical" in that large-scale structures are thought to have formed from gravitationally merging smaller-scale ones. In this picture, stars are the first to form. Over time, they cluster into galaxies, which slowly merge to form galaxy clusters, and so on. Structures of different sizes therefore have different characteristic time scales associated with their formation, with the largest objects taking the longest to materialize. Today, the largest known structures in the universe are galaxy "superclusters," which are clusters of galaxy clusters. They are still in the process of formation.

In 2013, Professor Webb's work was largely focused on a rare galaxy supercluster called RCS2319+00 comprising three high-mass galaxy clusters in close proximity. RCS2319 is considered rare because it is located at redshift \($z \leq 0.9$\), which translates to a light-travel distance of eight billion lightyears from Earth. (The cosmological redshift $z$ is a distance measure describing the extent to which light emitted by celestial objects at different distances from Earth is redshifted by the expansion of the universe.) This means that we are witnessing RCS2319 form eight billion years ahead of its time.

My job was to quantify the star formation rates of the brightest infrared galaxies in RCS2319. Known as "starburst" galaxies, these galaxies can produce hundreds to thousands of solar masses per year. The first step was to build a database of galaxies in the supercluster by selecting objects from a large multiwavelength spectroscopic catalogue based on redshift and coordinates in the plane of the sky. I then had to match the selected objects to those in a catalogue of 250 micron luminosities covering the same area of the sky. In this way, I identified 38 luminous infrared galaxies in the broad supercluster redshift range $0.858 \leq z \leq 0.946$.
